## What is Web scraping? 

Web scraping, also known as web data extraction, is the process of retrieving or ‚Äúscraping‚Äù data from a website. Unlike the mundane, mind-numbing process of manually extracting data, web scraping uses intelligent automation to retrieve hundreds, millions, or even billions of data points from the internet‚Äôs seemingly endless frontier.
